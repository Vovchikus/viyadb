## Formatting

To avoid unproductive debates on formatting, this project uses `clang-format` along with [LLVM Coding Style](http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html) to ensure a consistent style across all source files. To check formatting, run this before checking in your code:

```
./scripts/check-formatting.sh
```
